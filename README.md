# Open Data - Collection

[![GitHub contributors][contributors-shield]][contributors-url]

This repository is set up to support and keep track of non-code contributions during [Hacktoberfest 2022][hacktoberfest]. But it is also used outside this period to collect data sets.

In this way it would be easier for people to contribute to the projects of [NIPKaart][nipkaart]. The repository contains a list of files to collect different types of dataset URLs. You can add to these lists by editing the corresponding markdown file and opening a pull request.

- [Collect - open data platforms](./list_opendata_platforms.md)
- [Collect - disabled parking datasets](./list_disabled_parking_data.md)
- [Collect - offstreet parking datasets](./list_offstreet_parking_data.md)

A full list of tasks that NIPKaart has set up can be found [here][blog].
