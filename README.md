# Open Data - Collection

[![GitHub contributors][contributors-shield]][contributors-url]

This repository is set up to support and keep track of non-code contributions during [Hacktoberfest 2022][hacktoberfest].

In this way it would be easier for people to contribute to open data projects. The repository contains a list of files to collect different types of URLs. You can add to these lists by editing the corresponding markdown file and opening a pull request.

- [collecting open data platform urls](./list_opendata_platforms.md)
- [Collect urls to disabled parking datasets](./list_disabled_parking_data.md)

A full list of tasks that NIPKaart has set up can be found [here][blog].
